# David J Tinley

Hi, my name is David Tinley. I am currently a Computer Science student at `Kent State University`. I have just started my third year of school. We have been learning `C++` as our programing language and I have enjoyed it so far. I also have some brief experience with `HTML/CSS` and `Javascript`. I have been able to contribute to one open source project so far and that has been a great experience. I am currently looking for beginner level issues/projects to contribute to. I can be reached at `dtinley@kent.edu`
